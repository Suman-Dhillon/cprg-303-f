# ADR: Developing a Mobile app for a retail company
The decision has been made on the basis of better app performance and functionality like push notifications.

## Decision: Native, Web, or Hybrid app
We have decided to develop a native mobile app for the retail company. 

## Rationale 
On both iOS and Android platforms, native applications provide the finest performance and user interface with robust offline capabilities. They tend to be more performant compared to web or hybrid apps. They have direct access to device features like the camera, GPS, and sensors, which are essential for implementing push notifications. Moreover, they offer more security options, which are crucial when handling customer data and payment information.

## Status
Accepted 

## Consequences
Advantages: The native app will provide superior performance, responsiveness, and offline capabilities, enhancing user experience and ensuring data security.  
Challenges: Building native apps may require more effort and may take slightly longer development time compared to web or hybrid applications.

# ADR: Developing a Mobile app for a retail company
The decision has been made on the basis of team's need to decide how to handle image storage and optimization to ensure optimal performance.

## Decision: Data Storage
We have decided to use a combination of server-side caching, lazy loading, and image compression techniques for image storage and optimization. 

## Rationale 
Caching images on the server-side helps reduce the load on the server and improves the delivery of images to the app.  
Implementing lazy loading ensures that images are loaded only when they are visible in the userâ€™s viewport, reducing the load time and conserving bandwidth.  
Images may be made smaller without sacrificing much of their quality by using compression techniques like lossless and lossy compression. Users have quicker picture loading times and utilize less data as a result

## Status
Accepted 

## Consequences
Advantages: The selected strategy of lazy loading, server-side caching, and picture compression results in quicker image loading, less data use, and increased performance across the board for the app. The software will be more responsive, and users will notice faster image loading times.  
Challenges: Server-side caching, lazy loading, and image compression methods need careful configuration and continual optimization to be implemented and maintained. Furthermore, it is crucial to guarantee that image quality after compression is still acceptable.

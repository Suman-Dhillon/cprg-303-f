# ADR: Developing a Mobile app for a retail company
The decision has been made on the basis of gathering insights and metrics for improving the app's performance and user experience.

## Decision: Analytics Tool
We have decided to implement Google Analytics as the analytics tool for the application.

## Rationale 
The Google Analytics platform provides a consistent set of features and functionality, across both iOS and Android, such as event tracking, e-commerce tracking, and user segmentation. It can be easily integrated into the app using SDKs and APIs which simplifies the implementation process and ensures that data is collected effectively. Moreover, it provides user demographics and interests data, helping us understand the appâ€™s audience and tailor content accordingly.

## Status
Accepted 

## Consequences
Advantages: Integrating Google Analytics delivers a comprehensive set of analytics capabilities, facilitates integration, provides insights into user activity, and provides data visualization tools. This allows for data-driven decision-making and contributes to the app's performance and user experience.  
Challenges: The analytics tool must be managed and configured on an ongoing basis to ensure that data gathering corresponds with the app's developing goals and key performance metrics.
